        "    - **Ease of Use (for complex plots):** For basic plots, both libraries are relatively easy to use.

        "    - **DatetimeIndex:** Pandas introduces the `DatetimeIndex`, a specialized index for Series and DataFrames that stores datetime objects.\n",
        "    - **Resampling and Frequency Conversion:** Pandas offers robust capabilities for resampling time series data to different frequencies (e.g., from daily to monthly, or from hourly to minutely). This is essential for aggregating or interpolating data over different time periods.\n",
        "    - **Time-Based Indexing and Slicing:** With a `DatetimeIndex`, you can easily select data based on dates and time ranges using intuitive syntax (e.g., `df['2023']`, `df['2023-10']`, `df['2023-10-01':'2023-10-31']`).\n",

It allows you to aggregate data by one or more keys (columns) and organize the results into a new table (the pivot table) where the rows and columns are determined by the unique values in the specified keys.\n",

        "- NumPy's array slicing is significantly faster than Python's list slicing due to several key differences in how they are implemented and how they handle data in memory:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - **Contiguous Memory Allocation:** NumPy arrays store elements of the same data type in contiguous blocks of memory. This means that when you slice a NumPy array, NumPy can quickly calculate the memory addresses of the elements within the slice without having to jump around in memory. Python lists, on the other hand, store references to objects that can be scattered throughout memory, requiring more overhead to access elements during slicing.\n",
        "    - **Fixed Data Type:** NumPy arrays are homogeneous, meaning all elements have the same data type. This allows NumPy to use fixed-size memory blocks for each element and perform operations more efficiently. Python lists can store elements of different data types, which requires more flexible but less efficient memory management.\n",
